      <ProseP className="text-left">
        GenAI is a liminal space. It&apos;s changing rapidly. As a result, new
        terms are being added continiously.
      </ProseP>
      <ProseH2>The Problem</ProseH2>
      <ProseP>
        Understanding new AI &quot;buzzwords&quot; is not always an easy task.
        Definitions can be too abstract and fail to describe how these terms are
        actually being used.
      </ProseP>
      <ProseH3>Example</ProseH3>
      <ProseP className="italic">What is an AI agent?</ProseP>
      <ProseP>
        When we use the term &apos;agent&apos;, we typically refer to apps like
        customer-service chatbots or coding agent.
      </ProseP>
      <ProseP>
        IBM defines it as: &apos;a system that autonomously performs tasks by
        designing workflows with available tools.&apos;
      </ProseP>
      <ProseP>
        When we use the term &apos;agent&apos;, we typically refer to apps like
        customer-service chatbots or coding agent. The issues with this
        definition are:
      </ProseP>
      <ProseUL>
        <li>
          The word &apos;system&apos; is too generic. Agents usually refer to an
          app.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Agents are not always autonomous; human-in-the-loop and user-feedback
          are popular ways of ensuring agents are safely executing tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Agents don&apos;t always design workflows. Some apps use orchestration
          graphs to make LLM models perform single, specific tasks. Even when
          agents design workflows, it might be a sub-flow within a larger,
          developer-designed workflow.
        </li>
        <li>
          The pharse &apos;with available tools&apos; is too technical relative
          to the rest of the definition. Someone who doesn&apos;t know what an
          &apos;agent&apos; is will probably not understand that
          &apos;tools&apos; refers to programming functions that provide
          additional context or computations.
        </li>
      </ProseUL>
      Overall, the definition doesn&apos;t provide you with a concrete picture
      of what an agent is.
      <ProseH2>A Solution</ProseH2>
      <ProseP>
        A dictionary that simply and concretely defines AI terms. To do so, the
        dictionary will do the following:
      </ProseP>
      <ProseOL>
        <li>
          Provide a &apos;term type&apos; for each term. Similar to word types
          in traditional dictionaries, &apos;term type&apos; will describe what
          the term refers to. Examples include: architecture, document format,
          protocol, and behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide &apos;related terms&apos; for each term. This is also similar
          to conjugations/derivations in traditional dictionaries, and it helps
          route users to the root term. For example, some of the related terms
          to &apos;agent&apos; are agents and agentic.
        </li>
        <li>
          A simple, concrete definition that defines terms as they&apos;re
          commonly used. To do so, the dictionary will provide users with
          different definitions depending on their background.
        </li>
      </ProseOL>
      <ProseH3>Laying out the Definitions</ProseH3>
      <ProseP>
        So, what are the different definitions that will be offered, and why?
      </ProseP>
      <ProseUL>
        <li>
          First, there will be a general defintion that should be understood by
          the average professional.
        </li>
        <li>
          Furthermore, there should also be an &apos;original&apos; definition,
          as in a definition that is similar to how the term is popularly
          defined. In the aforementioned example, that would be the IBM
          definition.
        </li>
        <li>
          There should also be a software definition that should be understood
          by the average software developer.
        </li>
        <li>
          A diagram! A picture is worth a thousand words, and this dictionary is
          planning on using diagrams to convey the various elements associated
          with a term.
